Program and Code by Matthew Seaver


This Code does the following: 
Given a string of upper and lower case characters, calculate the smallest allowable balanced substring that 
has at least one iteration of all upper and lowercase characters of the original string. 
If the String does not have an upper or lower case equivalent of all characters, then there is no balanced string. 
 

Example:
Input: "azABaabba"
output: "ABaab

Input:"Technocat"
Output: "No balanced substring exists."
